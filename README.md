# NeuralNetworks_XOR

This is an python implementation of a two-layer artificial neural network to compute XOR of a given input. The training method is stochastic gradient descent with momentum, with two activation functions, one for each layer (One is tanh function and other one is sogmoid function). It uses cross entropy as loss function.

## Dependencies 
Numpy 

## Run
