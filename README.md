# NeuralNetworks_XOR

This is an python implementation of a two-layer artificial neural network to compute XOR of a given input. The training method is stochastic g##References radient descent with momentum, with two activation functions, one for each layer (One is tanh function and other one is sogmoid function). It uses cross entropy as loss function.

## Dependencies 
Numpy 

## Run 
``
   python xor_neural_network.py
